## Demo Script with Talk Track

### **Tier 1: Object Storage Layer** (5 minutes)
*"Let's start with the foundation - how modern data lakes store business data"*

#### Talk Track:
> "Today I'm going to show you how we've built a complete conversational business intelligence system using modern data lake architecture. We'll start at the bottom with object storage and work our way up to AI agents that can answer business questions in natural language."

> "First, let's look at our object storage layer. This is where all our business data lives - sales transactions, customer information, and geographic data."

#### Demo Actions:

1. **Show MinIO Console** (http://localhost:9001)
   ```
   Login: admin / password123
   Navigate to: semantic-lake bucket
   ```

2. **Explore the Data Lake Structure**
   ```
   semantic-lake/
   ├── data/
   │   ├── cities.parquet      # 10 major US cities
   │   ├── sales.parquet       # 1,000 e-commerce transactions  
   │   └── customers.parquet   # 200 customer profiles
   ```

3. **Show Parquet File Details**
   - Click on sales.parquet
   - Show file size, compression efficiency
   - Explain columnar storage benefits

#### Talk Track:
> "Notice we're using Parquet format - this gives us 10x compression compared to CSV and enables incredibly fast analytical queries. Each file contains real business data: sales transactions, customer profiles, and geographic information."

> "This is true **separation of storage and compute** - our data lives in object storage, completely independent from our analytics engine."

---

### **Tier 2: DuckDB Analytics Engine** (7 minutes)
*"Now let's see how DuckDB turns this object storage into a high-performance analytical database"*

#### Talk Track:
> "The magic happens when DuckDB connects directly to our object storage. DuckDB is like having a data warehouse that can query files directly from S3 or MinIO - no ETL required."

#### Demo Actions:

1. **Connect to DuckDB**
   ```bash
   # Connect via psql interface
   psql -h localhost -p 15432 -U root
   ```

2. **Show DuckDB Querying Object Storage**
   ```sql
   -- Show tables created from Parquet files
   SHOW TABLES;
   
   -- Query directly from MinIO
   SELECT * FROM cities LIMIT 5;
   
   -- Show analytical performance
   SELECT 
       region,
       COUNT(*) as city_count,
       SUM(population) as total_population
   FROM cities 
   GROUP BY region 
   ORDER BY total_population DESC;
   ```

3. **Demonstrate Analytics Speed**
   ```sql
   -- Complex analytical query
   SELECT 
       product_category,
       COUNT(*) as transaction_count,
       SUM(amount) as total_revenue,
       AVG(amount) as avg_order_value
   FROM sales 
   GROUP BY product_category 
   ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;
   ```

4. **Show Cross-Table Analytics**
   ```sql
   -- Join across different data sources
   SELECT 
       c.customer_type,
       COUNT(s.transaction_id) as transactions,
       SUM(s.amount) as total_spent
   FROM customers c
   JOIN sales s ON c.customer_id = s.customer_id
   GROUP BY c.customer_type
   ORDER BY total_spent DESC;
   ```

#### Talk Track:
> "Notice the speed - we're getting sub-second responses on analytical queries across our entire data lake. DuckDB is processing these Parquet files directly from object storage with no data movement."

> "This is the power of modern analytics - we can run complex business intelligence queries directly against our data lake without traditional data warehouse overhead."

---

### **Tier 3: Cube.dev Semantic Layer** (8 minutes)
*"Raw SQL is great for engineers, but business users need metrics, not tables"*

#### Talk Track:
> "Now here's where it gets interesting for business users. Raw SQL queries are fine for data engineers, but business people think in terms of metrics, KPIs, and business concepts. That's where our semantic layer comes in."

> "Before I show you the semantic layer, let me demonstrate why this matters. This is the difference between AI that sometimes gets the right answer, and AI that consistently delivers business-validated insights."

**💡 OPTIONAL: Semantic Layer Value Demo (Add 10 minutes)**
*If you want to emphasize the value proposition, run the semantic layer comparison:*
```bash
python3 semantic_layer_comparison.py
```
*This demonstrates the critical problems with text-to-SQL approaches and why semantic layers are essential. See SEMANTIC-LAYER-VALUE-DEMO.md for the complete script.*

#### Demo Actions:

1. **Open Cube.dev Playground** (http://localhost:4000)
   
2. **Show Semantic Models**
   - Navigate to Schema tab
   - Show Cities cube with business-friendly names
   - Show Sales cube with calculated measures
   - Show Customers cube with segmentation

3. **Build Business Queries Visually**
   
   **Query 1: Geographic Analysis**
   ```
   Measures: Cities.total_population
   Dimensions: Cities.city_name, Cities.region
   Order: Cities.total_population DESC
   Limit: 10
   ```

   **Query 2: Sales Performance**
   ```
   Measures: Sales.total_revenue, Sales.count
   Dimensions: Sales.product_category
   Order: Sales.total_revenue DESC
   ```

   **Query 3: Customer Segmentation**
   ```
   Measures: Customers.count, Customers.average_lifetime_value
   Dimensions: Customers.customer_type, Customers.credit_score_tier
   ```

4. **Show Generated SQL**
   - Click "Show SQL" to reveal the complex query
   - Demonstrate how semantic layer translates business concepts

5. **Test API Directly**
   ```bash
   # Show the REST API that powers everything
   curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/cubejs-api/v1/load \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "query": {
         "measures": ["Sales.total_revenue"],
         "dimensions": ["Sales.product_category"],
         "order": {"Sales.total_revenue": "desc"}
       }
     }'
   ```

#### Talk Track:
> "This is the key breakthrough - business users can now think in terms of 'revenue by product category' instead of 'SUM(amount) GROUP BY product_category'. The semantic layer translates business language into optimized SQL."

> "Notice how we're getting the same performance as our raw DuckDB queries, but now with business semantics. Every query is consistent, governed, and uses the same business logic."

---

### **Tier 4: MCP Integration** (5 minutes)
*"Now let's connect this to AI agents using the Model Context Protocol"*

#### Talk Track:
> "This is where the future gets exciting. We've built this entire data platform, but until now, AI agents couldn't easily access business data. That's where the Model Context Protocol comes in."

#### Demo Actions:

1. **Show MCP Server Running**
   ```bash
   # Test MCP server directly
   python3 semantic_mcp_server.py
   ```

2. **Test MCP Tools**
   ```bash
   # Test the tools available to AI agents
   python3 comprehensive_mcp_test.py
   ```

3. **Show MCP Protocol**
   ```json
   {
     "method": "tools/list",
     "params": {}
   }
   ```

   **Response:**
   ```json
   {
     "tools": [
       {
         "name": "query_semantic_layer",
         "description": "Execute business intelligence queries"
       },
       {
         "name": "get_schema_metadata", 
         "description": "Discover available data and metrics"
       },
       {
         "name": "suggest_analysis",
         "description": "Get analysis suggestions"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

#### Talk Track:
> "The MCP server exposes our entire semantic layer as tools that AI agents can use. Any AI platform that supports MCP can now access our business data and run sophisticated analytics."

> "This is the bridge between traditional business intelligence and conversational AI."

---

### **Tier 5: LangFlow Conversational AI** (10 minutes)
*"Finally, let's see how business users can just ask questions in natural language"*
